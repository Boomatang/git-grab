            ├── dotfiles
            └── git-grab
```

-----

### Main usage
```
grab add -u <url-to-repo>
grab fork <url-to-forked-repo>
grab --help
grab <command> --help
```
### List repos

#### Configure
To list the repos on the current system we most first generate a
list of the repo's. By default the first time this uses the path that is
set in `GRAB_PATH`.

```
grab list --generate
```

Each time after the paths listed in paths.yaml. The contents of
this file and the path to the file can be shown with.
```
grab list --show-paths
```

To add more than one path when generating the list use the flag `-p`
followed by the path of the folder you wish to include. `-p` can be
added as many times as required.

```
grab list --generate -p <path/to/file1> -p <path/to/file/2>
```

If there is an exiting paths.yaml the folder paths will get added
to the file.


When a paths.yaml exists this will be used when generating the
list. A new paths.yaml file can be created using.
```
grab list --generate --new-file
```

#### Usage
The list of repos that have been generated are saved in a file called
repo_list.yaml.

To get the basic list as shown below. These will be sorted by Org then
Repo name.
```
$ grab list

#  Org/Repo
-- -------------------
1  Boomatang/dotfiles
2  Boomatang/git-grab
3  github/gitignore

```

The `--wide` flag will display more information, such as the path to the
repo.
```

$ grab list --wide

#  Org/Repo             Location
-- -------------------- ------------------------
1  Boomatang/dotfiles   <path/to/repo/dotfiles>
2  Boomatang/git-grab   <path/to/repo/git-grab>
3  github/gitignore     <path/to/repo/gitignore>
```

List the repos belonging to a Org by using the `--org` or `-o` flags.
These feature will not be case sensitive.
```
$ grab list --org boomatang

#  Org/Repo
-- -------------------
1  Boomatang/dotfiles
2  Boomatang/git-grab

```

### Path to Repos
It is possible to get the system path to a repo using the `grab path`
command.

The example below opens the git-grab repo by stating the org/repo, the
list number or project url. The project url can have the path to a file
or pull request.
```
$ grab path Boomatang/git-grab
<path/to/repo/git-grab>
```
or
```
$ grab path 2
<path/to/repo/git-grab>
```
or
```
 $ grab path http(s)://github.com/Boomatang/git-grab
<path/to/repo/git-grab>
```
